# Machine Learning With SDSS Data

In this exercise, we're going to use machine learning algorithms + SDSS data (provided in this folder) in order to do either star-galaxy separation or estimate photometric redshifts. 

## Group Assignments

You should all have received a group assignment. 

Your tasks are as follows:
* groups 1&2: Scenario 1, data set 1, Logistic Regression + Random Forests (classification, supervised)
* groups 3&4: Scenario 1, data set 1, SVM + Random Forests(classification, supervised)
* groups 4&5: Scenario 1, data set 1, ??? + Random Forests (classification, supervised)
* groups 6&7: Scenario 1, data set 1, K-Means + Gaussian Mixture Models (classification, unsupervised)

* group 8: Scenario 2, data set 2, Ridge Regression + Random Forests (regression, supervised)
* group 9: Scenario 2, data set 4, SVR + Ridge Regression (regression, supervised)
* group 10: Scenario 2, data set 2, Ridge Regression + Random Forest (regression, supervised)
* group 11: Scenario 2, data set 4, SVR + Random Forest (regression, supervised)

* group 12, Scenario 2, data set 6, Ridge Regression + Random Forest (regression, supervised)
* group 13, Scenario 2, data set 7, SVR + Random Forest (regression, supervised)
* group 14, Scenario 2, data set 8, Ridge Regression + Random Forest (regression, supervised)
* group 15, Scenario 2, data set 9, SVR + Random Forest (regression, supervised)

## Scenarios

Depending on your group, your machine learning task falls into one of two scenarios.

### Scenario 1

 You live in a universe where stars are rare, but galaxies are common. Maybe you are on a planet around a lone star far, far out in intergalactic space, in a big, lonely void. Anyway, you don’t know anything about stars, but you really need to, because you don’t really know what that big glowing ball you call a sun is doing. But you had a stroke of genius! You have the feeling that plotting the colour versus the magnitude will tell you all sorts of useful things! Luckily, you have a big telescope observing everything around you, and you have a catalogue full of measurements. Now all you have to do is find the stars, and find them well, or that plot you’re going to make won’t show you what you think it does …

### Scenario 2

You and your friends like to build telescopes in your spare time, and you’re all pretty good at it. You’ve made a friendly bet between you: who of you will be the first to figure out how galaxies form? For that, you really need to know the distances to galaxies, and luckily, all of you have lots of data from your own, private spectroscopic surveys to train on. However, all of you have built your instruments slightly differently, so your data isn’t the same. You’ve agreed on a joint set of galaxies for which you agree what the redshifts are, but are you going to be able to predict them correctly … ?
